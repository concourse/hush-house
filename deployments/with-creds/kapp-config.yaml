# This file is to tell kapp to do a 3 way merge when modifying StatefulSets.
# K8s sets default values for fields that are not specified when creating a
# StatefulSet, but since kapp was not aware of this, it'll try to remove those
# fields. But since StatefulSet.spec is immutable, k8s will reject those changes
#
# To work around this, kapp provides a way to configure it by passing in a 
# Config file. This file is passed in along the helm templated ones on deploy
# but kapp is smart enough to read this file and not actully apply it to the
# cluster
